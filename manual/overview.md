# Overview

SVGsForReact is a set of reusables react components able to generate and to animate SVGs elements.

Here, we show different methods to render SVGs elements in the DOM without jquery or d3.js. Indeed, use d3 to manipulate SVGs DOM elements inside React components is clearly redundant with React functions.

To resume our point of view:
- Use d3 to compute elements positions (ease, range, domain...).
- Use only React to render elements and to manipulate the DOM (render, animations).

## Features

- Render a large number of SVGs elements in the DOM.
- Animate them easily.
